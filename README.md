# Machine Learning Playground
Contains machine learning and data science mini-projects I have done to horn my skills.

I have been deliberately practicing my machine learning skills through mini-projects.

1. [Iris machine learning project](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/iris_dataset_analysis)
2. [MNIST dataset](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/MNIST_dataset)
3. [Webscrapping](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/webscrapping)

And also by taking [some ML course projects](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/Machine_learning_real_world_projects) on Udemy

I'm also building deep learning skills in this [probabilistic AI playground](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/probabilistic_AI_playgraound)
